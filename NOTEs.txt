The first thing I would do is add a “continue shopping” button to the shopping cart page. This button would take the customer back to the last page they were on before they were redirected to the shopping cart page. This would allow the customer to continue shopping without having to start from the beginning again.
I would also add a “clear cart” button to the shopping cart page.This button would remove all items from the customer’s shopping cart.
I would add a “quantity” field to each item in the shopping cart.This would allow the customer to specify how many of each item they would like to purchase.
